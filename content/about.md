Well. I hate writing about me pages, which probably says a lot.

This blog is meant to be a space to capture various rambles/thoughts/maybe useful information at a pinch, with a notional focus on tech, open source and tech leadership. Although I'm fully expecting it to branch out into mental health rants at some point.

My main areas of interest at the time of writing this page are all things related to continuous delivery, observability ( with a bit of a love affair with EBPF ), kubernetes and the whole wider development enablement piece.

Opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my current or past employers.
