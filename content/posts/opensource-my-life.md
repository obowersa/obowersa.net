Open source has long been something incredibly important to me. Being able to contribute to open source projects or be part of various communities is one of my hard lines which I make sure companies are comfortable with when joining ( and that they are willing to back that up by marking it part of any employment contract). 

Part of the importance to me is just that I genuinely and whole heartedly believe in giving back to the world and in the good that open source can do. Another, and arguably larger part, is my own personal experience of how much of an impact open source communities and projects can have on someones life.

That's not to say it's all sunshine and roses. There's definitely unique challenges around the wider open source world ( and some not so unique ones which are just endemic of any group of people), but I can confidently say that I wouldn't be the person I am today if it wasn't for my own experience of open source. 

I grew up poor, desperately so, and in an incredibly abusive household. My prospects in life were not exactly rosey. Yet I had some luck in the form of a handful of people. One being my grandfather who saw technology as the future and during the few years I had with him before he died, invested a lot of effort into picking up second hand computers and letting me 'play'.

The other big influence was one paticular teacher at the school I was at. He got hold of an old machine which was going to be thrown away and spent time over a handful of evenings getting me to setup linux on it. That little machine became a bit of escape from reality and an opertunity for me to begin to explore this strange world outside of my imediate trauma.

I was hooked.

Those early days lead to me begining to push the boundaries of what I had access to, which eventually lead to me discovering IRC and a whole community of people out there. Chatzilla was my first gateway into that space ( and I have such incredibly fond memories of all the folk involved with mozilla as a whole ). For a kid who was in and out of school between my home situation and health issues at the time, I suddenly found a space where I didn't feel alone. 

That experience, and the ability to dig into the linux kernel and hack on various projects is what set me up for a career I wouldn't have been able to persue otherwise.  My health issues got worse and culminated in my family moving countires while I was still in hospital, I ended up leaving school without any secondary education qualifications too many and at a loss on  what to do.

For a while I resisted against trying for a job in technology, but, eventually I relented. I had some contacts through my time hanging out in IRC and through a series of fortunate events, managed to land my first job. 18 years on and I'm still in this industry and constantly learning.

Beyond those early days open source has given me so much. I've made close friends who I hope I'll have for the rest of my life. I found love ( and then promptly fucked it up, but open source can't take the blame for that ). I've had the opertunity to mentor people, to talk at conferences and to really feel a sense of 'belonging'. 

It hasn't always been smooth sailing, but the good has by far outweighed the bad. 

There's a line I've heard a few times about how open source is a family. Well, as someone who doesn't have a blood family who I have any contact with, it's an idea which really resonates with me. 

So here's to my open source family and the impact it's had on my life. I'm not entirely convinced I'd still be here without you all.
