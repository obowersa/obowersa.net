Open source is such an incredible thing. Whenever I try to explain it to someone who isn't part of the tech world the questions which get asked always remind me of just how wonderfully weird it is as a concept.  In this modern world, people and companies collaborating on things which have no cost, no direct value to the bottom line, and quite often (depending on licensing) in such a way which enables direct competitors to take that work and build upon it.

That's not to say folk should be naive about the complexities and motivations involved, but I really want to take a moment to call out how significant an achievement the open source movement is. 

Which brings me onto this post, notably, the first post of my blog after years of telling myself that any day now I'd start writing again. I want to start of this blog with a bit about me, my own experiences,  how I came to be working in tech and how much of an impact open source has had on my life. 

My journey in tech has been a little a-typical. I'm a secondary school drop out, leaving with no formal qualifications and never attended university. I came from an incredibly poor family, an abusive household and an area of the UK where prospects were pretty much non-existent. 

It's fair to say that there's a decent chance I probably wouldn't be here today if it hadn't been for the wider open source community, the tools which are out there and a few key people throughout the years. 

My early introduction to tech and the power of computing was due to two incredibly important people. My grandfather who I had the opportunity to spend 2 wonderful years living with as a child was a huge believer in the future needing a technical basis. He went out of his way to get hold of various magazines and devices for the pair of us to explore together. It's such a powerful thing having some of my happiest memories being grounded in this joy of exploration with someone who meant the world to me.

The second person was, oddly enough, a maths teacher. Looking back I think he was likely aware that my home situation was less than ideal. At the time though he noticed my fascination with computers and got hold of an old machine due to be thrown out which was running linux. He went out of his way to make sure I'd get time outside of the main school hours to use the machine, get to grips with the fundamentals and, most importantly, to 'play'.

That computer became my sanctuary within the larger chaos of my world. A place free from the abuse and trauma at home, somewhere I could keep my private thoughts and build my private worlds. It unlocked the doors for me on programming and the joy which can be found by just tinkering. It also gave me a semblance of control, an area where any mistakes which occurred were genuine and I was capable of correcting.

Fast forward a few years and one of my earliest jobs came as a direct result of that tinkering. I'd just got out of hospital after a pretty critical illness. I managed to land myself a position as a junior sys-admin for a local ISP working on their linux builds. 

At the same time I started to hang out in various open source communities ( the mozilla IRC in particular was a frequent haunt for years, to this day I think they had one of the most incredible communities ). Outside of being a place to learn and contribute, I made friends through these groups who ended up being critical life lines during some incredibly dark times. 

The power of open source for me then and now was immense. The ability to learn through asking questions, taking apart code and seeing how people who I genuinely admired approached problems gave me an education I would have completely missed otherwise. The communities themselves gave me a sense of family and belonging.

In the years since then, that power for me has only grown stronger. I ended up joining the CD Foundation ambassador program for a time as a result of one of those people who I looked up to on IRC presenting about it at a convention celebrating various open source tools. I made friends and found love (and then promptly messed it up, but that was a me thing not an open source thing ) through the communities I joined. I've also been able to mentor people who were in similar positions that I found myself in years before.

If I look at the technology stack for this blog. I'm writing it on an open source operating system, using an open source editor, with an open source version control solution which makes use of an open source static site generator and I'm then reviewing it in an open source browser.

From a cultural level I think it's impossible to overestimate just how much open source has changed the current state of the world. On a personal level though, it made me who I am and helped me survive and achieve things I'd of been incapable of doing otherwise.

So yeah. That's my personal journey with open source and the power it has to me. I can't wait to start giving back more to the wider community in small ways such as this blog going forward.
