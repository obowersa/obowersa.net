We have a lot of certificates in the industry, but, it's hard to know what's worth doing, what the experience of the certificate is like and what the study material is like.

Ideally I'd love to have a site where certs and reviews could be submitted and updated as the certs get updated.

The biggest challenge, I think, is trying to prevent abuse of the site. Things like review bombing or artificially inflating the certificates.

My rough idea on it is the whole thing would be a giant static site with reviews/etc submitted as pull requests
