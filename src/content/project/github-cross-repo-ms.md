While I'm generally a big fan of githubs project management, one major weakness is it's lack of support for cross repo milestones.

This has been a [known issue](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/276) for a while.

I'm thinking a tool which can manage synching milestone details across repo could be handy. It wouldn't be perfect, but, still might fill the gap
