Golang has some incredible CLI tooling ( namely [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)). Since I've been using C# more for my work at IGS, I've found myself missing the rich cli tools available in go.

At some point I'm aiming to create some equivelent libraries to make CLI's in C# less onerous.
