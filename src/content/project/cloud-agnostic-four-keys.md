The [DORA](https://dora.dev/) metrics and [Four Keys](https://github.com/dora-team/fourkeys) project are incredibly powerful tools for measuring the success of improvements to developer experience and the wider 'tech platform. However, four keys is now an archived project and was limited in it's hosting options.

I think there's a really cool project somewhere in there ( if it doesn't exist already ) to create an open source, self hosted, four keys alternative which is aimed at small-medium organisations. Especially tools like [DAPR](https://dapr.io/) and [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev/) there's some really powerful ways of approaching it.

This is largely something myself and my team have done internally at IGS recently, but I'd love to get the time to take it and polish it with more connectors.
