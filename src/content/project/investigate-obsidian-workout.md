I've never been super happy with a lot of the fitness trackers I've tried to use for weight training.

Given I'm already using Obsidian, and obsidian has data view + the chart plugin + templater, I feel like there might be an effective way to track and plan workouts with obsidian.

What I'm after as the end result is the ability to create templates for the different exercises. Create notes from those while on the phone. Fill in certain bits of metadata and then have that report back into a graph I can review.

Things I'll need to look into:

- [ ] Investigate if templater works on mobile
- [ ] Not a requirement, but see if a different template can be done based on day of the week
- [ ] Look into what metadata I'd want for tracking workouts
- [ ] Figure out how to then pull the data with dataview
- [ ] See what charts might be useful
