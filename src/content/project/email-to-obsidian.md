One of the things I did a lot with notion was capture ideas by emailing them. Since switching to obsidian this has been something I've missed.

It might be that I should use obsidian + notion, as they have slightly different use cases, butI'd really like to find a way to capture notes /ideas directly into obsidian when on the move
