Katacoda/killercoda are amazing tools for creating interactive learning environments. What I'd really like to see is a self hosted version with an easy to use way of creating training for internal teams. One of the big challenges I tend to see when trying to get adoption of tooling in development teams is providing suitable training in a way which isn't just an info-dump.
